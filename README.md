# Work Day Planner

For this app I used moment.js to coordinate the logic to color code
my description boxes depending on if the hour is past, present, or 
were still yet to come.  utilizing a for loop for 3 different tasks 
in my code allowed it to be very simple and short.  I was able to 
store local information, assign specific classes depending on the hour
and cycle through id's using 1 for loop.  It's surprising how many 
tasks can be achieve with 1 for loop.

## Purpose

This project helped me start to work on my pseudocoding and
planning of a small project to put together a work day planner
that could store .  I am pretty happy with the amount of code 
that ended up being necessary to complete.  It ended up being
 much shorter than anticipated.
